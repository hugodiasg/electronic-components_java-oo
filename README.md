# electronic-components_java-oo

This repo is a code in java to apply the concepts of the subject of the master's degree in electrical engineering (Special Topics in Control Systems) that addresses object-oriented programming and other contents.
The program addresses inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, composition, error handling, arrays and basic programming structures. 

The main purpose is to implement a Device from electronic components (such as resistors, transistors, ICs, etc). Furthermore, it is possible to implement a transfer function in phasor form to simulate an output from an input.

Below is the diagram showing the structure of the code.
